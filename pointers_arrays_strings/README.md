* **8-print_array.c**:
Function that prints n elements of an array of integers.
     - Prototype: `void print_array(int *a, int n);`
     - Where `n` is the number of elements of the array to be printed

### Project 2
* **0-strcat.c**:
Function that concatenates two strings.
     - Prototype: `char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);`
     - This function appends the `src` string to the `dest `string, overwriting the terminating null byte (`\0`) at the end of `dest`, and then adds a terminating null byte

* **1-strncat.c**:
Function that concatenates two strings.
     - Prototype: `char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);`
     - The `_strncat` function is similar to the `_strcat` function, except that
       * it will use at most `n` bytes from `src`; and
       * `src` does not need to be null-terminated if it contains `n` or more bytes
     - Return a pointer to the resulting string `dest`
* **2-strncpy.c**:
Function that copies a string.
     - Prototype: `char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);`
     - This function should work exactly like `strncpy`
* **3-strcmp.c**:
Function that compares two strings.
     - Prototype: `int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);`
     - This function should work exactly like `strcmp`
* **4-rev_array.c**:
Function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
     - Prototype: `void reverse_array(int *a, int n);`
     - Where `n` is the number of elements of the array
* **5-string_toupper.c**:
Function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
     - Prototype: `char *string_toupper(char *);`
* **6-cap_string.c**:
Function that capitalizes all words of a string.
     - Prototype: `char *cap_string(char *);`

* **7-leet.c**:
Function that that encodes a string into `1337`.
     - Prototype: `char *leet(char *);`
     - Letters `a` and `A` should be replaced by `4`
     - Letters `e` and `E` should be replaced by `3`
     - Letters `o` and `O` should be replaced by `0`
     - Letters `t` and `T` should be replaced by `7`
     - Letters `l` and `L` should be replaced by `1`
     - Only use one `if` in your code
     - Only use two loops in your code
     - Not allowed to use `switch`
     - Not allowed to use any ternary operation

### Project 3
* **0-memset.c**:
Function that fills memory with a constant byte.
     - Prototype: `char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);`
     - The `_memset()` function fills the first `n` bytes of the memory area pointed to by `s` with the constant byte `b`
     - Return a pointer to the memory area `s`
* **1-memcpy.c**:
Function that copies memory area.
     - Prototype: `char *_memcpy(char *dest, char *src, unsigned int n);`
     - The `_memcpy()` function copies `n` bytes from memory area `src` to memory area `dest`
     - Return a pointer to `dest`
* **2-strchr.c**:
Function that locates a character in a string.
     - Prototype: `char *_strchr(char *s, char c);`
     - The `_memcpy()` function copies `n` bytes from memory area `src` to memory area `dest`
     - Return a pointer to the first occurrence of the character `c` in the string `s`, or `NULL` if the character is not found
* **3-strspn.c**:
Function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
     - Prototype: `unsigned int _strspn(char *s, char *accept);`
     - Returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of `s` which consist only of bytes from `accept`
* **4-strpbrk.c**:
Function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
     - Prototype: `char *_strpbrk(char *s, char *accept);`
     - The `_strpbrk()` function locates the first occurrence in the string `s` of any of the bytes in the string `accept`
     - Returns a pointer to the byte in `s` that matches one of the bytes in `accept`, or `NULL` if no such byte is found
* **5-strstr.c**:
Function that locates a substring.
     - Prototype: `char *_strstr(char *haystack, char *needle);`
     - The `_strstr()` function finds the first occurrence of the substring `needle` in the string `haystack`. The terminating null bytes (`\0`) are not compared
     - Returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring, or `NULL` if the substring is not found.
* **7-print_chessboard.c**:
Function that prints the chessboard.
     - Prototype: `void print_chessboard(char (*a)[8]);`
* **8-print_diagsums.c**:
Function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
